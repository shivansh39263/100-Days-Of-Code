// Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

#include <stdio.h>

    int arr[30];
    int ceil_of_x=-1;

    scanf("%d",&n);

    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
